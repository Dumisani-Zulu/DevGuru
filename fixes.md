# DevGuru Application Fixes

## 1. Practice Page 404 Error
**Issue:** The practice page (accessed after selecting a completed lesson) was displaying a 404 error.

**Root Cause:** Mismatch between the URL parameter name (`lessonId`) and the Next.js route folder name (`[lessonid]`).

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated the parameter type in `app/lesson/[lessonid]/page.tsx` to match the folder name:
```typescript
// Changed from
type Props = {
  params: {
    lessonId: number;
  };
};

// Changed to
type Props = {
  params: {
    lessonid: number;
  };
};
```

## 2. Quiz Completion Issue
**Issue:** Quiz file wasn't completing when all challenges were finished.

**Root Cause:** The completion logic only checked if we reached the end of the challenges array, but didn't explicitly check if all challenges were completed.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added an additional check in the `onNext` function in `app/lesson/quiz.tsx`:
```typescript
const onNext = () => {
  const nextIndex = activeIndex + 1;
  const allChallengesCompleted = challenges.every(c => c.completed);
  
  if (nextIndex >= challenges.length || allChallengesCompleted) {
    setStatus("completed");
  } else {
    setActiveIndex(nextIndex);
    setStatus("none");
    setSelectedOption(undefined);
  }
};
```

This fix ensures the quiz completes in two scenarios:
1. When reaching the end of the challenges array
2. When all challenges have been completed, regardless of current position

## Future Considerations
1. Consider making route parameter naming more consistent across the application
2. Consider adding completion status indicators in the UI
3. Add proper error handling and user feedback for edge cases

## Testing Steps
After applying fixes:
1. Complete a lesson normally to verify the quiz completion works
2. Access a completed lesson through the practice mode to verify no 404 errors
3. Verify completion triggers properly when all challenges are done
4. Test edge cases (e.g., refreshing mid-quiz, network issues)
